This plugin contains a flexible theme for TypeDoc that builds additional features on 
top of typedoc-neo-theme's improved navigation and readability. Specifically, typedoc-next-theme
adds support for displaying and filtering by category, and displaying additional tags of your choice. It .

Additionally, it extends Typedoc with additional options for a richer user experience.

## Installation and Configuration

Install via npm:

`npm install -D typedoc-functional-theme`

Or yarn:

`yarn install typedoc-functional-theme`

Enable the theme when running from the command line:

`typedoc --options typedoc.json --theme node_modules/typedoc-functional-theme/bin/default`

Or you can specify the theme as a typedoc option in your `tsconfig.json` file:

```json
"typedocOptions": {
    "inputFiles": [
        "./src"
    ],
    "theme": "node_modules/typedoc-functional-theme/bin/default",
    "mode": "modules",
    "out": "docs",
    // "out": "docs",
    "exclude": [
        "**/src/test/*",
        "**/*.test.ts",
        "**/__tests__/*",
        "**/__mocks__/*"
    ],
    "excludeNotExported": true
},
```

## Theme features

### Directory-based module navigation

Just like with typescript-neo-theme, the left navigation bar is automatically organized
to group modules into directories. You can also customize what you do and don't display as a
plugin feature.

### Display tags that aren't displayed by the default themes

Typedoc has specific handling for only a [narrow set of tags](https://typedoc.org/guides/doccomments/#supported-tags). Other tags are still collected and available for display, but are not displayed
in the default themes. Even though @category is specifically supported, it is not displayed in the 
default theme. Other tags are collected but not displayed in the default theme.

### Category display and filtering

Even though typedoc has specific support for the `@category` tag, it doesn't display
categories as part of the default themes. With this theme, module-level categories
will be displayed as badges in the left menu. It's also possible to filter the left menu
by category to narrow down the modules to module types of particular interest.

The `@category` tag can be used for items within a module or file too, and will be displayed
there too.

## Plugin features

This plugin adds additional options that can be placed in your `typedoc.json` file.

### Links
You may want to specify additional links to appear in your header that don't point to
reference documentation but related documentation for your platform.

```json
"links": [{
    "label": "Guides",
    "url": "https://developers.google.com/actions/extending-the-assistant"
  }, {
    "label": "Reference",
    "url": "https://developers.google.com/actions/reference/nodejsv2/overview"
  }]
```

#### Outline
The left-hand side is a global navigation. This can be auto-generated by the Typedoc engine and
theme, or it can be manually specified by including an object in your options. You provide a custom
navigation with links that point to `modules/{object value}.html`.

```json
"outline": [{
    "Actions SDK": {
      "Overview": "actionssdk",
      "api/v2": "actionssdk_api_v2"
    },
    "Dialogflow": {
      "Overview": "dialogflow",
      "api/v1": "dialogflow_api_v1",
      "api/v2": "dialogflow_api_v2"
    }
  }]
```

#### Search
Not all of the files in the reference documentation may be useful for developers. You can select
certain pages to be high priority. These will retain the icon, along with displaying a subtitle and
a kind (like `class` or `interface`). Items not included will be deprioritized, with smaller text.

```json
"search": [{
    "name": "dialogflow.DialogflowConversation.data",
    "subtitle": "Persistent data"
  }, {
    "name": "conversation/response.BasicCard",
    "subtitle": "Rich response"
  }, {
    "name": "conversation/response.BasicCardOptions",
    "subtitle": "Rich response"
  }]
```

### Link to source
You can set up links to your source code under each property in the documentation.

```json
"source": [{
  "path": "https://github.com/actions-on-google/actions-on-google-nodejs/blob/master/src/",
  "line": "L"
}]
```

For a particular file and line, this can take you to a valid GitHub source for the
Actions on Google Node.js project.
